# NEX

**Capability-safe, effect-typed AI-native programming language (Rust backend).**

NEX is designed for **secure autonomous systems**: programs must declare effects (e.g. `!io`, `!async`) and capabilities (e.g. `fs.read`, `net.listen`) to access sensitive operations.

## Demo

```bash
./dev run examples/see_output.nex
cargo test
