# Long-Term Vision

NEX aims to become:

- A secure execution substrate for AI agents
- A deterministic policy-safe systems language
- A foundation for AI-native operating environments

The core invariants will not change:

- Determinism
- Explicit authority
- Structured concurrency
- Compile-time enforcement

Security is not optional.
It is structural.
